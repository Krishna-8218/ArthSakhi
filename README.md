# ArthSakhi 🌱

ArthSakhi is a gamified, voice-first financial learning platform designed for women in Bharat.  
It helps users build practical financial confidence by learning through safe, interactive simulations instead of lectures or quizzes.

## Problem Statement
Despite many awareness programs, women often lack hands-on experience in managing money.  
Fear of making mistakes and low digital trust prevent confident use of tools like UPI, banking, savings, and insurance.

## Solution
ArthSakhi uses a “Family Farm” simulation game where users manage a virtual household or small business and make everyday financial decisions using virtual money.  
This creates a zero-risk environment to practice real-life financial choices and understand their long-term impact.

## Key Features
- Family Farm Simulator for savings, loans, insurance, and budgeting  
- Safe UPI practice using virtual money (no real transactions)  
- Voice-first experience with local language support  
- Story-based scenarios showing long-term outcomes  
- Gamified learning with points and progress tracking  

## Tech Stack
- Flutter (Android)
- Dart
- Local Storage (Hive / SQLite)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Firebase (optional, for sync & analytics)

## 📱 Project Status
This project is developed as a **hackathon prototype (MVP)**.  

## 👥 Team
- ByteShift

## 📌 Note
ArthSakhi does not use real bank accounts or UPI APIs.  
All financial interactions are simulated for learning purposes only.
